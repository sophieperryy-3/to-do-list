# Continuous Integration Pipeline
#
# Triggers: Every push and pull request
# Purpose: Catch issues early (shift-left testing)
#
# Stages:
# 1. Checkout code
# 2. Install dependencies
# 3. Lint (code quality)
# 4. Type check (TypeScript)
# 5. Unit tests
# 6. Security scans (DevSecOps)

# COMPLIANCE EVIDENCE:
# - Lint results: Check "Run ESLint" step logs
# - Test results: Check "Run unit tests" step logs
# - Security scans: Check "Security audit" and CodeQL logs
# - Build artifacts: Available in Actions → Artifacts
#
# This pipeline demonstrates:
# ✅ Continuous Integration (automated testing on every push)
# ✅ Shift-left security (security scans in CI, not just production)
# ✅ Quality gates (pipeline fails if tests/lint fail)
# ✅ Compliance evidence (all logs retained in GitHub Actions)
